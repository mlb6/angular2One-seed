## Motivation
During the [ng-europe Q&A session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-x1QKriY90) one of the questions was "What can we do to avoid rewriting an application entirely when angular 2 will be released?". The angular team proposed that we could start writing angular 1.x application in ES6. So, I told myself: why not in atScript?

In that same conference two other projects have also been announced : [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org) and [the new angular router](https://github.com/angular/router#the-new-angular-router). As a very-early-adopter I wanted to try everything... Now!

When I discovered the angular 2 [code example](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/examples/src/hello_world/index_common.js), I tried to make it work with angular 1.x. It is still experimental but it works.

## Features
* Angular injection support by [Annotations](Annotations.md).
* Basic support of Angular 2 Component Directives. ([Annotations](Annotations.md))
* Asynchronous angular bootstap.

### Tools and librairies
* [atScript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YUzC-1d0V1-Q3V0fQ7KSit97HnZoKVygDxpWzEYW0U) transpilation with [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler)
* [New Angular Router](https://github.com/angular/router#the-new-angular-router)
* [Angular Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org) 
* [~~Dgeni~~](https://github.com/angular/dgeni#dgeni---documentation-generator-) ~~for documentation generation.~~ (coming soon, WIP)
* [AMD modules](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) with requireJS
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build everything fast.
* [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) synchronize your browser with your code.
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS with superpowers.
* [amd-optimize](https://github.com/scalableminds/amd-optimize#amd-optimize-) and [almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond#almond) for AMD module in a single file (prod).
* [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) for e2e and unit tests



### Continuous Integration
* Build server : [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* Automated tests : [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/)
* Code Coverage : [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) (*)

> (*) Code coverage is partially supported. Because sources are generated by traceur, it is not possible to browse them in coveralls.io. The code cannot be 100% covered because of traceur. At least you can verify that coverage does not decrease.
 
 
## Build
There is 3 types of build :  Dev, Prod ES5 ~~& Prod ES6~~ (WIP)
### Install
1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`

### Development
* Assertion library.
* Dynamic AMD module load.
* Auto-build with browser synchronisation

1. `gulp serve` (build, start server, and watch file changes)
2. `gulp test` (continuous unit tests)

### Production (ES5)
* No assertion library
* All libraries and modules are in a single JS file with a revision number (for cache busting).
* HTML, CSS ans JS are minified.

1. `gulp serve:prod` (build and start server)

or 

1. `gulp build:prod` (build)
2. `gulp serve:prod:only` (start server)
